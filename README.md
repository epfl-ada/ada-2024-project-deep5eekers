# Gender in the Film World

## Abstract (150 words)

In this project we will explore the role of gender in the film industry. We have decided to investigate a variety of ideas and themes around gender. We will consider questions about gender in roles, character portrayals, and general sentiment. 

We were inspired to choose this topic because gender representation in film provides a lot of insight into how the world/region portrays gender roles. With our data story, we will bring to light the gender imbalances and stereotypes present in films over time. We will effectively show how women are disproportionately represented in film. We will show the possible character stereotypes that are damaging to our view of women. Also, we will show that the general sentiment associated with men and women characters is more favorable to men. We feel that creating this story is important because it will bring up the possible problems with gender representation in film.

## Research Questions

In this section we have listed the main research questions we would like to address during this project. 

- What are the gender imbalances in acting and production roles? And how have these imbalances changed over time?

- What are the stereotypical character types across gender? How are these characters portrayed? Have these stereotypes changed with time? 

- In general, are there different adjectives, actions, and personas that are given to men versus women characters? Are the words used in either case seen as positive or negative? Can we assess the sentiment around different gendered roles?

## Supplementary Data

In addition to the CMU dataset, we are using the Wikipedia pages that exist for a subset of the CMU dataset movies. With these Wikipedia pages, we will access the plot summaries and the movie's director. The plot summaries will be used to potentially supplement the smaller summaries in the CMU dataset. For our analysis, the plot summaries are being used extract information and sentiment about the different characters. We are accessing the directors because we want to study the gender imbalances in movie production jobs. We will study how this imbalance has changed with time.
