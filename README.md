# Gender in the Film World

## Abstract (150 words)

In this project we will explore the role of gender in the film industry. We have decided to investigate a variety of ideas and themes around gender. We will consider questions about gender in roles, character portrayals, and general sentiment. 

We were inspired to choose this topic because gender representation in film provides a lot of insight into how the world/region portrays gender roles. With our data story, we will bring to light the gender imbalances and stereotypes present in films over time. We will effectively show how women are disproportionately represented in film. We will show the possible character stereotypes that are damaging to our view of women. Also, we will show that the general sentiment associated with men and women characters is more favorable to men. We feel that creating this story is important because it will bring up the possible problems with gender representation in film.

## Research Questions

In this section we have listed the main research questions we would like to address during this project. 

- What are the gender imbalances in acting and production roles? And how have these imbalances changed over time?

- What are the stereotypical character types across gender? How are these characters portrayed? Have these stereotypes changed with time? 

- In general, are there different adjectives, actions, and personas that are given to men versus women characters? Are the words used in either case seen as positive or negative?
